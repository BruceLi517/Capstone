This is my Capstone project. The data for this project comes from CDC called Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset which contains healthcare statistics and lifestyle survey information about people in general along with their diagnosis of diabetes. It consists of 253680 instances, 14 binary features and 6 categorical features, 1 numerical variable other than the target feature, which indicates whether individuals have diabetes or not.
